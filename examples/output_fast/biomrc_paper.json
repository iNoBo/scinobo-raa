      "Creating large corpora with human annotations is a demanding process in both time and resources.",
      "Research teams often turn to distantly supervised or unsupervised methods to extract training examples from textual data.",
      "In machine reading comprehension (MRC) (Hermann et al., 2015), a training instance can be automatically constructed by taking an unlabeled passage of multiple sentences, along with another smaller part of text, also unlabeled, usually the next sentence.",
      "Then a named entity of the smaller text is replaced by a placeholder.",
      "In this setting, MRC systems are trained (and evaluated for their ability) to read the passage and the smaller text, and guess the named entity that was replaced by the placeholder, which is typically one of the named entities of the passage.",
      "This kind of question answering (QA) is also known as cloze-type questions (Taylor, 1953).",
      "Several datasets have been created following this approach either using books (Hill et al., 2016;Bajgar et al., 2016) or news articles (Hermann et al., 2015).",
      "Datasets of this kind are noisier than MRC datasets containing human-authored questions and manually annotated passage spans that answer them (Rajpurkar et al., 2016(Rajpurkar et al., , 2018;;Nguyen et al., 2016).",
      "They require no human annotations, however, which is particularly important in biomedical question answering, where employing annotators with appropriate expertise is costly.",
      "For example, the BIOASQ QA dataset (Tsatsaronis et al., 2015) currently contains approximately 3k questions, much fewer than the 100k questions of a SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), exactly because it relies on expert annotators."
     ],
     [
      "To bypass the need for expert annotators and produce a biomedical MRC dataset large enough to train (or pre-train) deep learning models, Pappas et al. (2018) adopted the cloze-style questions approach.",
      "They used the full text of unlabeled biomedical articles from PUBMED CENTRAL, 1 and METAMAP (Aronson and Lang, 2010) to annotate the biomedical entities of the articles.",
      "They extracted sequences of 21 sentences from the articles.",
      "The first 20 sentences were used as a passage and the last sentence as a cloze-style question.",
      "A biomedical entity of the 'question' was replaced by a placeholder, and systems have to guess which biomedical entity of the passage can best fill the placeholder.",
      "This allowed Pappas et al. to produce a dataset, called BIOREAD, of approximately 16.4 million questions.",
      "As the same authors reported, however, the mean accuracy of three humans on a sample of 30 questions from BIOREAD was only 68%.",
      "Although this low score may be due to the fact that the three subjects were not biomedical experts, it is easy to see, by examining samples of BIOREAD, that many examples of the dataset do 1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/",

      "Many instances contain passages or questions crossing article sections, or originating from the references sections of articles, or they include captions and footnotes (Table 1).",
      "Another source of noise is METAMAP, which often misses or mistakenly identifies biomedical entities (e.g., it often annotates 'to' as the country Togo)."
     ],
     [
      "In this paper, we introduce BIOMRC, a new dataset for biomedical MRC that can be viewed as an improved version of BIOREAD.",
      "To avoid crossing sections, extracting text from references, captions, tables etc., we use abstracts and titles of biomedical articles as passages and questions, respectively, which are clearly marked up in PUBMED data, instead of using the full text of the articles.",
      "Using titles and abstracts is a decision that favors precision over recall.",
      "Titles are likely to be related to their abstracts, which reduces the noise-tosignal ratio significantly and makes it less likely to generate irrelevant questions for a passage.",
      "We replace a biomedical entity in each title with a placeholder, and we require systems to guess the hidden entity by considering the entities of the abstract as candidate answers.",
      "Unlike BIOREAD, we use PUBTATOR (Wei et al., 2012), a repository that provides approximately 25 million abstracts and their corresponding titles from PUBMED, with multiple annotations. 2",
      "We use DNORM's biomedical entity annotations, which are more accurate than METAMAP's (Leaman et al., 2013).",
      "We also perform several checks, discussed below, to discard passage-question instances that are too easy, and we show that the accuracy of experts and nonexpert humans reaches 85% and 82%, respectively, on a sample of 30 instances for each annotator type, which is an indication that the new dataset is indeed less noisy, or at least that the task is more feasible for humans.",
      "Following Pappas et al. (2018), we release two versions of BIOMRC, LARGE and LITE, containing 812k and 100k instances respectively, for researchers with more or fewer resources, along with the 60 instances (TINY) humans answered.",

      "Experimental results show that AS-READER and AOA-READER perform better on BIOMRC, with the accuracy of AOA-READER reaching 70% compared to the corresponding 52% accuracy of Pappas et al. (2018), which is a further indication that the new dataset is less noisy or that at least its task is more feasible.",
      "We also developed a new BERTbased (Devlin et al., 2019) MRC model, the best version of which (SCIBERT-MAX-READER) performs even better, with its accuracy reaching 80%.",

      "Human performance was also higher on a sample of BIOMRC compared to BIOREAD, and biomedical experts performed even better.",
      "We also developed a new BERT-based model, the best version of which outperformed all other meth-ods tested, reaching or surpassing the accuracy of biomedical experts in some experiments.",
      "We make BIOMRC available in three different sizes, also releasing our code, and providing a leaderboard."

     [
      "We plan to tune more extensively the BERTbased model to further improve its efficiency, and to investigate if some of its techniques (mostly its max-aggregation, but also using sub-tokens) can also benefit the other neural models we considered.",
      "We also plan to experiment with other MRC models that recently performed particularly well on opendomain MRC datasets (Zhang et al., 2020).",
      "Finally, we aim to explore if pre-training neural models on BIOREAD is beneficial in human-generated biomedical datasets (Tsatsaronis et al., 2015)."

   "Paragraph": "Creating large corpora with human annotations is a demanding process in both time and resources. Research teams often turn to distantly supervised or unsupervised methods to extract training examples from textual data. In machine reading comprehension (MRC) (Hermann et al., 2015), a training instance can be automatically constructed by taking an unlabeled passage of multiple sentences, along with another smaller part of text, also unlabeled, usually the next sentence. Then a named entity of the smaller text is replaced by a placeholder. In this setting, MRC systems are trained (and evaluated for their ability) to read the passage and the smaller text, and guess the named entity that was replaced by the placeholder, which is typically one of the named entities of the passage. This kind of question answering (QA) is also known as cloze-type questions (Taylor, 1953). Several datasets have been created following this approach either using books (Hill et al., 2016;Bajgar et al., 2016) or news articles (Hermann et al., 2015). Datasets of this kind are noisier than MRC datasets containing human-authored questions and manually annotated passage spans that answer them (Rajpurkar et al., 2016(Rajpurkar et al., , 2018;;Nguyen et al., 2016). They require no human annotations, however, which is particularly important in biomedical question answering, where employing annotators with appropriate expertise is costly. For example, the BIOASQ QA dataset (Tsatsaronis et al., 2015) currently contains approximately 3k questions, much fewer than the 100k questions of a SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), exactly because it relies on expert annotators.",

They extracted sequences of 21 sentences from the articles. The first 20 sentences were used as a passage and the last sentence as a cloze-style question. A biomedical entity of the 'question' was replaced by a placeholder, and systems have to guess which biomedical entity of the passage can best fill the placeholder. This allowed Pappas et al. to produce a dataset, called BIOREAD, of approximately 16.4 million questions. As the same authors reported, however, the mean accuracy of three humans on a sample of 30 questions from BIOREAD was only 68%. Although this low score may be due to the fact that the three subjects were not biomedical experts, it is easy to see, by examining samples of BIOREAD, that many examples of the dataset do 1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ 'question' originating from caption: \"figure 4 htert @entity6 and @entity4 XXXX cell invasion.\"",

To avoid crossing sections, extracting text from references, captions, tables etc., we use abstracts and titles of biomedical articles as passages and questions, respectively, which are clearly marked up in PUBMED data, instead of using the full text of the articles. Using titles and abstracts is a decision that favors precision over recall. Titles are likely to be related to their abstracts, which reduces the noise-tosignal ratio significantly and makes it less likely to generate irrelevant questions for a passage. We replace a biomedical entity in each title with a placeholder, and we require systems to guess the hidden entity by considering the entities of the abstract as candidate answers. Unlike BIOREAD, we use PUBTATOR (Wei et al., 2012), a repository that provides approximately 25 million abstracts and their corresponding titles from PUBMED, with multiple annotations. 2 We use DNORM's biomedical entity annotations, which are more accurate than METAMAP's (Leaman et al., 2013). We also perform several checks, discussed below, to discard passage-question instances that are too easy, and we show that the accuracy of experts and nonexpert humans reaches 85% and 82%, respectively, on a sample of 30 instances for each annotator type, which is an indication that the new dataset is indeed less noisy, or at least that the task is more feasible for humans.

Few studies compare the brain regions they involve, their numbers and intrinsic attributes. METHODS: Records of all @entity1 referred to Radiation Oncology for treatment of symptomatic brain metastases were obtained. Computed tomography (n = 56) or magnetic resonance imaging (n = 72) brain scans were reviewed. RESULTS: Data from 68 breast and 62 @entity2 @entity1 were compared. Brain metastases presented earlier in the course of the lung than of the @entity0 @entity1 (p = 0.001). There were more metastases in the cerebral hemispheres of the breast than of the @entity2 @entity1 (p = 0.014). More @entity0 @entity1 had cerebellar metastases (p = 0.001). The number of cerebral hemisphere metastases and presence of cerebellar metastases were positively correlated (p = 0.001). The prevalence of at least one @entity3 surrounded with > 2 cm of @entity4 was greater for the lung than for the breast @entity1 (p = 0.019). The @entity5 type, rather than the scanning method, correlated with differences between these variables. CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases from lung occur earlier, are more @entity4 , but fewer in number than those from @entity0 . Cerebellar brain metastases are more frequent in @entity0 .",

The original entity names are shown in square brackets. Both 'edematous' and 'edema' are replaced by '@entity4', because PUBTATOR considers them synonyms. The question is the title of the article, with a biomedical entity replaced by XXXX. @entity0 is the correct answer. Finally, to avoid making the dataset too easy for a system that would always select the entity with the most occurrences in the abstract, we removed a passage-question instance if the most frequent entity of its passage (abstract) was also the answer to the cloze-style question (title with placeholder); if multiple entities had the same top frequency in the passage, the instance was retained. We ended up with approx. 812k passage-question instances, which form BIOMRC LARGE, split into training, development, and test subsets (Table 2). The LITE and TINY versions of BIOMRC are subsets of LARGE. In all versions of BIOMRC (LARGE, LITE, TINY), the entity identifiers of PUBTATOR are replaced by pseudo-identifiers of the form @entityN (Fig. 1), as in the CNN and Daily Mail datasets (Hermann et al., 2015). We provide all BIOMRC versions in two forms, corresponding to what Pappas et al.  (2018) call Settings A and B in BIOREAD. 6 In Setting A, each pseudo-identifier has a global scope, meaning that each biomedical entity has a unique 6 Pappas et al. (2018) actually call 'option a' and 'option b' our Setting B and A, respectively. pseudo-identifier in the whole dataset. This allows a system to learn information about the entity represented by a pseudo-identifier from all the occurrences of the pseudo-identifier in the training set. For example after seeing the same pseudo-identifier multiple times a model may learn that it stands for a drug, or that a particular pseudo-identifier tends to neighbor with specific words. Then, much like a language model, a system may guess the pseudoidentifier that should fill in the placeholder even without the passage, or at least it may infer a prior probability for each candidate answer. In contrast, Setting B uses a local scope, i.e., it restarts the numbering of the pseudo-identifiers (from @en-tity0) anew in each passage-question instance. This forces the models to rely only on information about the entities that can be inferred from the particular passage and question. This corresponds to a nonexpert answering the question, who does not have any prior knowledge of the biomedical entities.",

SCIBERT-SUM-READER is closer to AS-READER and AOA-READER, which also sum the scores of multiple occurrences of the same entity. This summing aggregation, however, favors entities with several occurrences in the passage, even if the scores of all the occurrences are low. Our experiments indicate that SCIBERT-MAX-READER performs better. In all cases, we only update the parameters of the MLP during training, keeping the parameters of SCIBERT frozen to their pre-trained values to speed up training. With more computing resources, it may be possible to improve the scores of SCIBERT-MAX-READER (and SCIBERT-SUM-READER) further by fine-tuning SCIBERT on BIOMRC training data.",

In both settings, SCIBERT-MAX-READER clearly outperforms all the other methods on both the development and test sets. The performance of SCIBERT-SUM-READER is approximately ten percentage points worse than SCIBERT-MAX-READER's on the development and test sets of both settings, indicating that the superior results of SCIBERT-MAX-READER are to a large extent due to the different aggregation function (max instead of sum) it uses to combine the scores of multiple occurrences of a candidate answer, not to the extensive pre-training of SCIBERT. AOA-READER, which does not employ any pre-training, is competitive to SCIBERT-SUM-READER in Setting A, and performs better than SCIBERT-SUM-READER in Setting B, which again casts doubts on the value of SCIBERT's extensive pre-training.

   "Paragraph": "The trainable parameters of AS-READER and AOA-READER are almost double in Setting A compared to Setting B. To some extent, this difference is due to the fact that for both models we learn a word embedding for each @entityN pseudoidentifier, and in Setting A the numbering of the identifiers is not reset for each passage-question instance, leading to many more pseudo-identifiers (31.77k pseudo-identifiers in the vocabulary of Setting A vs. only 20 in Setting B); this accounts for a difference of 1.59M parameters. 11 The rest of the difference in total parameters (from Setting A to B) is due to the fact that we tuned the hyperparameters of each model separately for each setting (A, B), on the corresponding development set. Hyper-parameter tuning was performed separately for each model in each setting, but led to the same numbers of trainable parameters for AS-READER and AOA-READER, because the trainable parameters are dominated by the parameters of the word embeddings. Note that the hyper-parameters of the two SCIBERT-based models (of their MLPs) were very minimally tuned, hence these models may perform even better with more extensive tuning. AOA-READER was also better than AS-READER in the experiments of Pappas et al. (2018) on a LITE version of their BIOREAD dataset, but the development and test accuracy of AOA-READER in Setting A of BIOREAD was reported to be only 52. 41% and 51.19%,respectively (cf. Table 3); in Setting B, it was 50.44% and 49.94%, respectively. The much higher scores of AOA-READER (and AS-READER) on BIOMRC LITE are an indication that the new dataset is less noisy, or that the task is at least more feasible for machines. The results of Pappas et al. (2018) were slightly higher in Setting A than in Setting B, suggesting that AOA-READER was able to benefit from the global scope of entity identifiers, unlike our findings in BIOMRC. 12 igure 3 shows how many passage-question instances of the development subset of BIOMRC LITE have 2, 3, . . . , 20 candidate answers (top left), and the corresponding accuracy of the basic baselines (top right), and the neural models (bottom). BASE3+ is the best basic baseline for 2 and 3 candidates, and for 2 candidates it is competitive to the neural models. Overall, however, BASE4 is clearly the best basic baseline, but it is outperformed by all neural models in almost all cases, as in Table 3. SCIBERT-MAX-READER is again the best system in both settings, almost always outperforming the other systems. AS-READER is the worst neural model in almost all cases. AOA-READER is competitive to SCIBERT-SUM-READER in Setting A, and slightly better overall than SCIBERT-SUM-READER in Setting B, as can be seen in Table 3. Pappas et al. (2018) asked humans (non-experts) to answer 30 questions from BIOREAD in Setting A, and 30 other questions in Setting B. We mirrored their experiment by providing 30 questions (from",

We also showed the same questions of each setting to two biomedical experts. As in the experiment of Pappas et al. (2018), in Setting A both the experts and non-experts were also provided with the original names of the biomedical entities (entity names before replacing them with @entityN pseudo-identifiers) to allow them to use prior knowledge; see the top three zones of Fig. 4 for an example. By contrast, in Setting B the original names of the entities were hidden. Table 4 reports the human and system accuracy scores on BIOMRC TINY. Both experts and nonexperts perform better in Setting A, where they can use prior knowledge about the biomedical entities. The gap between experts and non-experts is three points larger in Setting B than in Setting A, presumably because experts can better deduce properties of the entities from the local context. Turning to the system scores, SCIBERT-MAX-READER is again the best system, but again much of its performance is due to the max-aggregation of the scores of multiple occurrences of entities. With sum-aggregation, SCIBERT-SUM-READER obtains exactly the same scores as AOA-READER, which again performs better than AS-READER. (AOA-READER and SCIBERT-SUM-READER make different mistakes, but their scores just happen to be identical because of the small size of TINY.) Unlike our results on BIOMRC LITE, we now see all systems performing better in Setting A compared to Setting B, which suggests they do benefit from the global scope of entity identifiers. Also, SCIBERT-MAX-READER performs better than both experts and non-experts in Setting A, and better than non-experts in Setting B.
